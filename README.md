# Tic Tac Toe

## Abstract
This app provides users with a delightful experience of playing a game of Tic-Tac-Toe with another individual. The app can also be used as a practicing tool in order to increase an individuals understanding of the game which will help them become a better competitor. 

## Installation Instructions

## Preview of App

## Context
I am in my 5th week of Mod 1 and was given one week to create a user friendly application that allows users to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript in order to complete this project. When writing the HTML, I worked to create a very clean skeleton with as few containers as possible that would get the job done. Declaring classes and ID's with easy to pin-point names was taken into consideration. When working on CSS, I wanted to creat a color-popping theme for the user while keeping it simple. The CSS rules are organized by order of the page and all elements that would use the same CSS rule are merged into one rule. Once I completed the HTML and CSS, my goal was to not have to edit it when I started working on JavaScript. There were some instances that I did have to change such as adding an additional ID or class name in HTML or changing up some CSS rules once innerHTML was used in JavaScript. My JavaScript code is sorted from the top to bottom with query selectors first, global variables used for the data model second, event listeners third and functions last. I aimed to write the functions that would change the data model first, then tie the DOM in.

## Learning Goals
- Create an application completely independently without step-by-step instructions
- Further understanding of logic behind creation of functions
- Importance of manipulating the data model before the DOM
- Understanding the importants of haiving an eye for detail

## Wins + Challenges
A win overall for me was writing the JavaScript behavior. This was the first time that I was not given step by step tasks to take in order to create an application and the first time on my own as well. Once I finished my HTML and CSS, I really struggled on where to even start with JavaScript. I took a day off and started writing the logic on my own in a notebook. Once I got the courage to put my hands on the keyboard, it was hard to stop.

I really struggled with making the function that would end the game in a draw. The function that I wrote is quite lengthy and has nested for loops which is not preferred. Completeing this functionn, however, was also a win for me because I worked on it for a really long time. When I got the logic to work to end the game, I was happy. I would want to revisit it to see how I can complete this task without nested for loops in order to advance my knowledge.

I did end the project with two bugs that I could not fix. One was disabling a box that was occupied. Though the function did work, I was unable to get the cursor to have something visual on it so that the user could see that they cannot click the box. The other but was alternating players after a game ends. The game will end and restart, however, it will restart with the same player that it ended with.

## Future Features
- Local storage added
- When game ends, alternate players starts the next game
- User can pick their own token
- User can pick their own background
